For an overview of Selenium concepts and commands see http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0.1/reference.html .

Xebium accepts actions and assertions in the following form (taking either one or two parameters):

| ensure | do | <command> | on | <target> |
| ensure | do | <command> | on | <target> | with | <value> |

An easy way to get started writing such scripts is using the Selenium IDE Xebium formatter.

Accessors can be used for more advanced scripts:

| check        | is | <command> | on | <target> | <expectedResult>                  |
| $myVariable= | is | <command> | on | <target> | <expectedResult>                  |
| check        | is | <command> | on | <target> | with | <value> | <expectedResult> |
| $myVariable= | is | <command> | on | <target> | with | <value> | <expectedResult> |
